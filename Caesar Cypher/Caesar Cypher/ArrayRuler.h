/*Guidelines for this project (not sure if those are good ones need feedback on them)

	- If possible find rememberable and short names for your functions;
	- Don't spam your main() with output loops;
	- Always try to keep main() clean;
	- Member Variables of another class should be named after the act of getting / using something from them;
	- Documentation should be simply worded and in short sentences. if possible (clean and simple);
