/*Guidelines for this project (not sure if those are good ones need feedback on them)

	- If possible find rememberable and short names for your functions;
	- Create a good and readable structure if it works, keep it, if not change it.
	- Member Variables of another class should be named after the act of getting / using something from that class;
	- Documentation should be simply worded and in short sentences. if possible (clean and simple);
